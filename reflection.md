Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

Cafe:
I overloaded the constructor twice. The first constructor was simply a default constructor (similar to building's default constructor) which sets everything to 0 or unknown. The second takes in only the inventory integers as params and no name or address, in case the name/address is undecided. I also overloaded the restock method to restock in set amounts, not just enough for the ordered coffee. 

House:
I overloaded the constructor twice. The first constructor was a default constructor (similar to building's default constructor) which sets name and address to unknown and sets dining and elevator booleans to false. The second only takes dining and elevator params (no name, address, floors) in case the user wants to customize dining/elevators before deciding on a name/address.

Library:
I overloaded the constructor twice. The first constructor was a default constructor (similar to building's default constructor) which sets name and address to unknown and sets  elevator boolean to true. The second takes in the elevator boolean as its only param in case the user wants to change the default value to false (since the first constructor makes it true by default).

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Worked: Testing and reading through the given files + classes before to understand their functionality

Didn't work: Not testing every method as its written

Advice: Read the entire assignment before starting because it can help you better understand the best way to program. Also, when there are less instructions, think through the project and make a plan first.
